# The OG

An OpenGraph image generator written purely in PHP, so you don't need to install another runtime somewhere
or a whole browser instance just to create a dynamic PNG.

## Sponsorship
The OG is completely free to use for personal or commercial use. If it's making your job easier or you just want to
make sure it keeps being supported and improved, I'd really appreciate your donations!
